Suddenly, she heard a strange sound coming from the backyard. Curious, she stepped outside and was shocked to see a {} standing next to the garden hose. \
But this was no ordinary animal — it had a {} backpack on its back and was calmly {} like it did this every day. \
Jumana couldn’t believe her eyes. She slowly walked closer and whispered, 'Hello?' The animal turned, gave her a little bow, and tossed her a glowing pebble. \

All because of one unexpected encounter with a mysterious visitor who came without warning... and changed everything.".format(adj1,emotion,noun,animal,adj2,verb)
